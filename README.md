# Welcome to the 2048 Game!

The 2048 Game is a fun and addictive puzzle game where your objective is to combine numbered tiles on a grid to create a tile with the number 2048.

## How to Play

### Goal
Merge tiles of the same number to reach the 2048 tile.

### Controls
- **Keyboard**: Use the Arrow Keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to slide the tiles in the desired direction.
- **Touch Devices**: Swipe in the direction you want the tiles to move.
- **Mouse**: Click and drag in the direction you wish the tiles to slide.

### Gameplay Mechanics
- **Sliding Tiles**: When you move, all tiles slide as far as possible in the chosen direction until they are stopped by either the edge of the grid or another tile.
- **Combining Tiles**: If two tiles with the same number collide while moving, they will merge into a single tile with the sum of their values (e.g., 2 + 2 = 4).
- **New Tiles**: After each move, a new tile with a value of 2 or 4 will randomly appear on an empty spot on the grid.
- **Scoring**: Your score increases by the value of the tiles you combine.

### Game Over
The game ends when there are no empty spaces on the grid and no adjacent tiles with the same value, making it impossible to make any further moves.

## Tips for Success

- Plan ahead to avoid blocking high-value tiles.
- Try to keep your highest value tile in a corner.
- Focus on merging smaller tiles to open up space on the grid.

Enjoy the challenge and have fun strategizing your way to the 2048 tile!
